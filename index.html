            <h1>"In the near future, I hope to become a Developer."</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: stretch;">
                For being an Expert Developer, I will try my best to reach my goal.This mission continues untill I
                complete my terget. This mission is my passion.For this,HTML. is the foundation on which all web pages
                are built, so by learning and applying different instructions, I will be able to reproduce something
                of what i see in sites my may be visiting everyday. Take my time and choose a beginner book (or
                online course) that i can follow with the least amount of effort, then follow it through.After HTML,
                comes CSS and Javascript. These three technologies work together to produce everything i see in my
                browser, and as soon as i build up my knowledge on them to the point where i can use a client-side
                framework and create a website, i will be employable in a junior web developer position. This is very
                hard to achieve by focusing on a more traditional language, since it requires generally more study and
                effort for someone to become competent that way.Taking a junior position will expose me to much more
                information, force me to quickly build up my skills, and will eventually steer me to a server - side
                technology. It will also serve to educate me on two other aspects of being a programmer: Working in a
                team, and delivering timely results. These almost as important as any coding skills i may seek to
                obtain, and take up much, much more time than coding itself. The additional incentive of getting paid
                while i am learning will not hurt, either. From there on, i can take a breath. i am there.
                Welcome to a creative trade of constant study and self - improvement!One final piece of advice for i
                to make the most out of my efforts: Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Most programmers are generally
                cool guys, and will be happy to assist i understand and master anything, as long as i are willing to
                work and listen.After all, i am ready for everything.

                            The demand for web developers is already pretty high and it’s only expected to continue
                            rising
                            over
                            the next decade. Driving the demand for web developers is the explosion in Internet usage;
                            it’s
                            currently booming and shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.

                <p>
                    My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity . I was always fascinated by how
                    websites
                    worked , how they could be so visually appealing and interactive , and how they connected people
                    across
                    the globe . One day , I stumbled upon a website about HTML , the language that forms the basic
                    structure
                    of web pages . The code seemed like a magic language , able to transform simple text into vibrant ,
                    functional websites . I was hooked . I devoured every resource I could find , learning the basics of
                    HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
